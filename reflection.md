Most of the work was done on the mobile version, which can be viewed from the same link above, but on a mobile phone
<br>

At first, my idea was completely mobile focused with some 3d aspirational content that I quickly realized I wouldn't be able to achieve in the given amount of time. Therefore, I restructured my goals to be just making a clean, straight-forward simple mobile-friendly site while also finishing my portfolio I had already started prior to this class. I never got the time to finish it to my satisfaction and this project made that happen, which I am extremely happy about! It finally gave me the motivation to apply to internships. Anyway, as a result, I ended up fixing my current portfolio website and making a completely different mobile-friendly site as my skills in three.js working and looking great on mobile are non-existent.

The changes I made to my desktop portfolio website were:
* Added Github repositories for all projects
* Created dynamic project containers that showcase a preview of each project
* Linked each project container to their corresponding repos
* Fixed the resume and icon links

The desktop portfolio then looked like this afterwards:

Then I proceeded onto making the static, simple mobile website. This website included almost all of the same content except images and wild css animations. My thinking was if a recruiter were to view my portfolio, they would most likely do it through a laptop. The mobile website is simply a courtesy in case someone is looking at it on the fly because they forgot some type of information. Therefore, the content is straight to the point, but still (hopefully) slightly professional feeling.
The peer feedback I received on my draft mostly revolved around lack of content, which I expected since I hadn't incorporated everything yet.

I then proceeded to add all of the projects that I created repos for and added more to education.

    - Converted all project previews to be about 384x400 for best views on desktop
:heavy_check_mark: Use responsive design (e.g. @media queries, flex-wrap, auto-fill, etc) to dynamically resize elements based on viewport width
:heavy_check_mark: Animate HTML elements via JavaScript (e.g. image carousel) or CSS (e.g. :hover / :focus events)
    - hover on buttons and color changes when clicked
    - special hover on resume button
:heavy_check_mark: Add interactivity via JavaScript (e.g. on-click events)
    - downloadable resume

    -nav bar for mobile
:heavy_check_mark: Load site publicly over the internet (e.g. with GitHub Pages)

### Conclusion ###
I really enjoyed this project as it felt personally fulfilling. I was already stressed about not being able to finish my portfolio before the semester started and am really happy I got to finish it in a class.
